-Amazon EC2 and Apache Tomcat credentials  
More specifically, we want the private key .pem file (if you don't remember what this file is, please check the AWS_EC2-2019.pdf, page 11). 
Also, we want the username and password of your Apache Tomcat manager (see AWS_EC2.pdf page 31)




-a list that apportions credit (possibly shared) for each code file to the team members. (It would also be good to have these as comments in your code files).
